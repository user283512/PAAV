[X] Voxel Grid Filtering: 
  Voxel Grid Filtering is a filtering technique commonly used in the Point Cloud Library 
  to reduce the density of a point cloud while still maintaining the structure and 
  main characteristics of the original point cloud. 
  This technique is used to simplify data, reduce noise, speed up computations and 
  make data processing more efficient.

[X] Segmentation based on geometric:
  Segmentation is the process of dividing a point cloud into regions or clusters 
  representing distinct entities or features.
  The main goal of segmentation is to isolate significant parts of a 3D scene, 
  such as physical objects (e.g., a chair or a wall) or specific features 
  (such as planes, curves, or surfaces). 
  This is useful for subsequent analysis steps, such as object recognition, 
  registration (alignment) of scenes or feature extraction.

[X] Euclidean Cluster Extraction:
  Euclidean Cluster Extraction is a technique used in point cloud processing, 
  specifically in the Point Cloud Library, to identify and separate distinct objects 
  based on the spatial proximity of points in the cloud. 
  In practice, the algorithm attempts to group together points that are close to each other 
  in three-dimensional space, forming clusters, where each cluster represents a potential physical object.
